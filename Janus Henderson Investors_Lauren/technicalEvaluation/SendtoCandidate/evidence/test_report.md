## Test Results Summary

### Test Scenario 1: No Duplicate Columns
- **Status**: PASS
- **Description**: Verified that no column is reported twice within any file in scope
- **Implementation**: Implemented column uniqueness validation per file
- **Files Tested**: All y_* files in the files directory

#### Detailed Results:
- y_02.01.csv: PASS
- y_02.03.csv: PASS
- y_02.02.csv: PASS
- y_01.01.csv: PASS
- y_07.01.csv: PASS
- y_99.01.csv: PASS

### Test Scenario 2: [Yes/No] Type Validation
- **Status**: PASS
- **Description**: Validated that columns marked as [Yes/No] type in requirements meet the criteria
- **Implementation**: Cross-referenced requirements with actual data values
- **Files Tested**: All y_* files in the files directory

#### Detailed Results:
- y_02.01.csv: PASS
- y_02.03.csv: PASS
- y_02.02.csv: PASS
- y_01.01.csv: PASS
- y_07.01.csv: PASS
- y_99.01.csv: PASS

## Potential Issues and Bugs

### 1. Data Type Inconsistencies
- Some [Yes/No] fields contain variations like "YES", "NO", "Y", "N"
- Recommendation: Standardize the format to either "Yes"/"No" or "Y"/"N"

### 2. Requirements Documentation
- The requirements file (Data Fields_New.xlsx) may need version control
- Consider implementing a change management process for requirement updates

## Assumptions Made

1. All files in scope (y_*) follow a consistent format
2. [Yes/No] fields should be case-insensitive
3. Empty or null values in [Yes/No] fields are considered invalid
4. The requirements file is the source of truth for data definitions

## Solution Explanation for Non-Technical Stakeholders

We have implemented an automated testing framework that:
1. Checks for duplicate columns in each report file
2. Validates that [Yes/No] fields contain appropriate values
3. Can be easily updated when requirements change
4. Provides clear reporting of any issues found

The solution is designed to be:
- Maintainable: Easy to update when requirements change
- Scalable: Can be extended to include additional tests
- Reliable: Consistent results across multiple runs
- User-friendly: Clear reporting of issues and results

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional validation rules
2. Add more detailed error reporting
3. Create a user interface for running tests
4. Set up automated test scheduling
5. Implement requirement version control
